Thanks to this system, you can review the messages written by players and make revisions or whatever you desire.

# Maximum Customization And Configuration
Chat Rank+ offers maximum customization according to your tastes. Just go to the path of your addon, look for the Chat Rank+ folder, then on ‚Äòscripts‚Äô and finally on the ‚Äòconfig‚Äô file, where you can set the ranks and everything else as you like.

- üñ•Ô∏è Pc: 
```bash
%userprofile%\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang\
```
- üì±Android:
 ```bash
/Android/data/com.mojang.minecraftpe/files/games/com.mojang/
```
- üì±Ios: 
 ```bash
/On My iPhone/Minecraft/games/com.mojang/
```

Remember that if the addon is inserted in the ‚Äòbehavior_packs‚Äô folder, the changes made will not work when you enter the world or when you run the ‚Äò/reload‚Äô command to reload the scripts. To have real-time changes, the addon must be inserted in the ‚Äòdevelopment_behavior_packs‚Äô folder.
