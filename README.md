Remember that when you add the score in chat, the scoreboard and the player must have a score on that scoreboard, otherwise it will not work.

# Auto Mute System

# Auto Ban Words System
This system allows you to ban certain words that you don’t want players to write in chat. You can give a warning to players that, after a certain number of times they say that word, they will be muted. Obviously, the system can be disabled and customized as you wish.

# Broadcast System
The system is equipped with messages that will be sent to all players every so often, of warning or whatever you desire. You can disable it whenever you want and customize it as you prefer from the file config.

# Saving Player Messages System
Thanks to this system, you can review the messages written by players and make revisions or whatever you desire. You will have a menu with all the names of the players who have written and, in case there are many, you can search for them by writing the name to see their messages. You can even search within the players’ messages if you are looking for something specific. Obviously, this part can also be disabled from the configuration file. The system is equipped with a function that, after a certain period of time, resets the database. Whoever has the command permissions for the menu, remove, add or log, will be notified via message that the database has been reset.
| -rank log | -rank menu |
<p align="center"><img src="https://api.mcpedl.com/storage/submissions/214662/images/chat-ranks_10.png" loading="eager" /></p>
Obviously, in addition to seeing the player’s messages, you can also remove the player’s messages with the appropriate button present when you view all of his messages.

# Maximum Customization And Configuration
Chat Rank+ offers maximum customization according to your tastes. Just go to the path of your addon, look for the Chat Rank+ folder, then on ‘scripts’ and finally on the ‘config’ file, where you can set the ranks and everything else as you like.

- 🖥️ Pc: 
```bash
%userprofile%\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang\
```
- 📱Android:
 ```bash
/Android/data/com.mojang.minecraftpe/files/games/com.mojang/
```
- 📱Ios: 
 ```bash

```

Remember that if the addon is inserted in the ‘behavior_packs’ folder, the changes made will not work when you enter the world or when you run the ‘/reload’ command to reload the scripts. To have real-time changes, the addon must be inserted in the ‘development_behavior_packs’ folder.
