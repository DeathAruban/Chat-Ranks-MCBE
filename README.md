# How does it work
## To use this component, you will need to activate the experimental mode of your world, to ensure that the addon works.
<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/DeathAruban/Chat-Ranks-MCBE/blob/main/img/experimental.png" loading="eager" /></p>
Inside the world you will have 4 commands available

- -rank help   (to see all commands available for rank)
- -rank list   (opens a form in which you can see the list of permissions, to add more modify the scripts file config)
- -rank add    (opens a form in which you can add permission to a player)
- -rank remove   (opens a form in which you can remove permission to a player)

obviously to use the commands you must have admin permissions
then you will need to add the tag
```json5
tag @s add admin
```
```json5
tag @s add mod
```
obviously these are the ones present in the config file that you find in script, which you can modify as you wish
```json5
access_command:["admin","mod"],
```
with the -rank help command you will find the list of all available commands.

with the -rank list command you will find a list of ranks available in your world
<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/DeathAruban/Chat-Ranks-MCBE/blob/main/img/list.png" loading="eager" /></p>
with the -rank add command a UI will appear in which you first select the player and then the rank you want to add
<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/DeathAruban/Chat-Ranks-MCBE/blob/main/img/add.png" loading="eager" /></p>
with the -rank remove command a UI will appear in which you first select the player and then the rank you want to remove from the player
<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/DeathAruban/Chat-Ranks-MCBE/blob/main/img/add.png" loading="eager" /></p>

## Configuration
Inside the addon, in the ‚Äòscripts‚Äô folder, you will find a file named ‚Äòconfig‚Äô. There you will already find a preconfigured list of ranks, which you can modify to your liking, adding or removing the existing ones.
```json5
        2:{
            tag:'admin', 
            chat_display:'¬ß8[¬ßdAdmin¬ß8]',
            chat_display_after:'¬ßa>>', 
            chat_color:'¬ß2', 
            name_player_color:'¬ß4', 
            description:'Has a high level of control over the server, often can change gameplay and has permission to ban or unban players'
        },
```
for example if the player has an admin in chat he will have those possibilities listed above

- tag:' '  the tag that the player must have to have changes in chat
- chat_display:' ' as you will see the first part of the player role chat
- chat_display_after:' ' what will be after the player's name
- chat_color:' ' the color of the message the player sends 
- name_player_color:' ' color of the player's name that will be seen in chat
- description: ' ' the tag description you will see with the -rank list command

example of how it looks in chat:
<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/DeathAruban/Chat-Ranks-MCBE/blob/main/img/chat.png" loading="eager" /></p>
Instead, in the case of a common player, therefore without rank, you have two possibilities: to show the chat in a standard or modified way. You just need to set ‚Äòtrue‚Äô or ‚Äòfalse‚Äô on ‚Äòdefault‚Äô in ‚Äòconfig‚Äô.

```json5
        1:{
            default:true, here
            chat_display:'¬ß8[¬ßasteve¬ß8]',
            chat_display_after:'¬ß8>>',
            name_player_color:'¬ßf',
            chat_color:'¬ßf'
        },
```
