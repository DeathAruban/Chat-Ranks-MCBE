# Detailed Features 🛠️

<details>
<summary>📂 Main Configuration File (`scripts/config/config.js`)</summary>

The heart of Chat Ranks+ customization lies in the `config.js` file located in the `scripts` folder of the behavior pack.

export let config = {
prefix: "-", // Prefix for commands

permission: { /* ...rank configuration... */ },
auto_mute: { /* ...auto-mute configuration... */ },
database: { /* ...log database configuration... */ },
broadcast: { /* ...broadcast configuration... */ },
ban_words: { /* ...ban words configuration... */ },
time_zone: "UTC+2", // Time zone configuration

belowname: { /* ...below name text configuration... */ },

chat_rank_version: "1.10.0" // Do not modify
};

Be sure to consult your `config.js` file for all options and detailed comments.
</details>

<details>
<summary>👑 Multi-Rank System and Message Formatting</summary>

Assign and customize player ranks. Each rank can have a unique appearance in chat, specific commands, and a priority level for message formatting if multiple ranks are assigned.

</p>

**Configuration (`scripts/config/config.js` > `permission`):**

permission: {
default: {
state: true,
rank: "§8[§asteve§8]",
description: "Basic server role",
command: ["help", "info"],
score: "", // Scoreboard name for $score_point
message: "$rank §f$player §8>> §f$message"
},
admin: {
state: true,
rank: "§8[§dAdmin§8]",
description: "Has a high level of control over the server, often can change gameplay and has permission to ban or unban players",
command: ["list", "help", "add", "remove", "menu", "log", "mute", "info", "name"],
level: 0, // Highest priority
score: "level",
// Example with $rainbow and $score_point
message: "§f[§8Level: §b$score_point§f]$rank $rainbow§4$player§r §a>> §2$message"
},
mod: {
state: true,
rank: "§8[§aMod§8]",
description: "This role helps maintain order in the server, can ban or unban players, and often answers player questions",
command: ["help", "info", "list", "add", "remove", "menu", "log", "mute"],
score: "",
level: 1,
message: "$rank §d$player §d>> §5$message"
},
helper: {
state: true,
rank: "§8[§dHelper§8]",
description: "This role is often given to players who are willing to help other players. They usually do not have moderation permissions.",
command: ["help", "info", "list", "mute"],
score: "",
level: 2,
message: "$rank §a$player §8>> §f$message"
},
builder: {
state: true,
rank: "§8[§8Builder§8]",
description: "This role is given to players who contribute to building structures in the server.",
command: ["help", "info", "list"],
score: "",
level: 3,
message: "$rank §f$player §8>> §3$message"
},
vip: {
state: true,
rank: "§8[§6Vip§8]",
description: "This is a role often given to donors or long-time players. They might have some special perks.",
command: ["help", "info"],
score: "",
level: 4,
message: "$rank §e$player §8>> §6$message"
}
// ...add more custom ranks as needed
}

**Keywords for `message`:**
- `$player`: Player's name (or custom name if set).
- `$message`: Player's original message.
- `$rank`: Player's primary rank text (based on `level` priority if multiple ranks are assigned; otherwise, it shows concatenated ranks by default based on `chat_rank.js` logic for `$rank`).
- `$score_point`: Player's score from the scoreboard specified in `score`.
- `$rainbow`: Applies a rainbow effect to the following text (until `§r` is encountered).

**Available commands for ranks (defined in `permission[rankName].command` array):**
`add`, `remove`, `list`, `help`, `menu`, `log`, `mute`, `info`, `name`.
You assign these command strings to the `command` array for each rank to grant them access.
</details>

<details>
<summary>📈 Score-Based Rank System</summary>

Display a specific score (e.g., "level", "money") of a player directly in the chat format, fetching it from an existing scoreboard.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://api.mcpedl.com/storage/submissions/214662/images/chat-ranks_5.png" loading="eager" alt="Rank with Score Example" />
</p>

**Configuration (`scripts/config/config.js` > `permission` > `[rankName]`):**
- `score: "scoreboard_name"`: Specifies the scoreboard objective to get the score from (e.g., `"level"`). Make sure this scoreboard objective exists in your world.
- `message: "...$score_point..."`: Use the `$score_point` keyword in the message template to display the score.

**Example (within a rank like `admin` in the `permission` object):**

    admin:{
        // ... other admin settings
        score:"level",  
        message:"§f[§8Level: §b$score_point§f]$rank §4$player §a>> §2$message"
    }

The player must have a score on the `level` scoreboard objective for `$score_point` to display correctly. If the score or objective is not found, it defaults to "0" or may not appear as expected depending on internal handling.
</details>

<details>
<summary>🤫 Auto-Mute System</summary>

Prevent spam by automatically muting players who send messages too quickly.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://api.mcpedl.com/storage/submissions/214662/images/chat-ranks_6.png" loading="eager" alt="Auto-Mute Example" />
</p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://api.mcpedl.com/storage/submissions/214662/images/chat-ranks_7.png" loading="eager" alt="Manual Mute Menu" />
</p>

**Configuration (`scripts/config/config.js` > `auto_mute`):**

auto_mute: {
state: true, // true to enable, false to disable
time_spam: 200, // Minimum time in ticks between messages from a player to avoid being muted (20 ticks = 1 second). Default is 200 ticks (10 seconds).
// The actual messages for "You've been muted...", "You cannot write...", "You have been unmuted!" are handled by
// the addon's internal translation files (e.g., using keys like 'chatrank.mute.message').
// Your original README listed example messages here, but these are typically for localization in the addon itself.
rank_immune: ["admin", "mod"] // Array of rank tags (e.g., "admin") that are exempt from auto-mute.
}

Players manually muted or unmuted via commands will also receive corresponding messages.
</details>

<details>
<summary>🤬 Auto Ban-Words System</summary>

Filter unwanted words from chat. Players receive a warning, and after a configurable number of violations, they are muted.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://api.mcpedl.com/storage/submissions/214662/images/chat-ranks_8.png" loading="eager" alt="Ban Words Example" />
</p>

**Configuration (`scripts/config/config.js` > `ban_words`):**
ban_words: {
state: true, // true to enable, false to disable
time: 3, // Number of times a player can send a message containing any banned word before being automatically muted.
// The messages for "The following word is banned..." and "You have been muted for sending..."
// are typically handled by the addon's internal translation files.
rank_immune: ["admin", "mod"], // Array of rank tags exempt from the banned word filter.
words: [ // Array of words or phrases (case-insensitive) that are considered banned.
"test", // Example, likely too common for real use
"test1"
// "another bad phrase"
]
}

</details>

<details>
<summary>📢 Broadcast System</summary>

Send automatic, periodic messages to all online players.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://api.mcpedl.com/storage/submissions/214662/images/chat-ranks_9.png" loading="eager" alt="Broadcast Example" />
</p>

**Configuration (`scripts/config/config.js` > `broadcast`):**

broadcast: {
state: true, // true to enable, false to disable
prefix: "§f[§dbroadcast§f] §8>> ", // Optional prefix to display before each broadcast message.
message: [ // An array of messages to broadcast. Messages are sent sequentially, looping back.
"§f[§dbroadcast§f] §8>> §bNew Add-on released on YouTube ", // Your original examples
"§f[§dbroadcast§f] §8>> §bTry visiting our YouTube channel",
"§f[§dbroadcast§f] §8>> §bBest server exists in Minecraft Bedrock",
"§f[§dbroadcast§f] §8>> §dDiscord code §aNKy9A9RAe8"
],
time: 200 // Time interval in ticks between sending each broadcast message (20 ticks = 1 second). 200 ticks = 10 seconds (quite fast).
}

Note: Your original example messages in the `message` array already included a prefix-like structure. You can simplify by putting the common prefix in the `prefix` field and having just the core messages in the `message` array.
</details>

<details>
<summary>💾 Message Saving System (Log)</summary>

Records messages sent by players, mute information, and used banned words. Accessible via the `-rank log` command.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://api.mcpedl.com/storage/submissions/214662/images/chat-ranks_10.png" loading="eager" alt="Message Log Example" />
</p>

**Configuration (`scripts/config/config.js` > `database`):**

database: {
state: true, // true to enable logging, false to disable.
// Database_name: "ChatSendSave" - This seems to be an internal prefix for dynamic properties. Not directly for user display.
reset_time_state: true, // If true, the message history (not full player data like mutes/ban stats) for players is cleared periodically.
max_message: 200,       // Maximum number of messages to store per player. Older messages are removed.
reset_time: 30000000,   // Time interval in ticks at which the message database is cleared (if reset_time_state is true). 30,000,000 ticks is very long (over 17 real-world days).
// 1,209,600 ticks = 7 days.
// reset_message: The message "The messages in the Database have been reset!" is handled by internal translations
// and sent to players with specific permissions (log, add, remove, menu).
}

- Logs are stored using world dynamic properties, which have storage limits.
- The automatic reset (`reset_time_state`) clears only the chat message history part of the player's logged data.
- Players with permissions for `add`, `remove`, `menu`, or `log` commands are notified when the database reset occurs.
- The log interface allows viewing messages, mute history, and banned word occurrences for each player, and also allows resetting parts of a player's data.
</details>

<details>
<summary>👁️ Below Name Display (Belowname)</summary>

Customize the text that appears above players' heads (nametag). This is useful for showing ranks, health, the player's last sent chat message, and more.

**Configuration (`scripts/config/config.js` > `belowname`):**

belowname: {
state: true, // true to enable custom below-name text, false for default nametags.
// Use '\n' for new lines. Available keywords:
// $player: Displays the player's name (or their custom name if set via -rank name).
// $rank: Displays the player's primary rank text (determined by the lowest 'level' in permission settings).
// $multirank: Displays all of the player's assigned rank texts (from permission), usually space-separated.
// $life: Displays the player's current health points numerically.
// $message: Displays the player's last sent chat message. (Note: This is visible for a short duration, approx. 10 seconds, and might be visually spammy).
text: "$multirank\n$player\n§c♥$life \n$message " // Example from your config.js
// Simpler example: "$rank\n$player §c♥$life"
}

The `-rank name` command is used to manage the custom names that `$player` will display if set.

<details>
<summary>🗣️ Proximity Chat</summary>

When enabled, chat messages are only visible to players within a defined radius of the sender.

**Configuration (`scripts/config/config.js` > `proximity_chat`):**

proximity_chat: {
state: false, // Set to true to enable proximity chat as the default chat mode.
range: 10     // The radius (in blocks) from the sender within which messages are visible to other players.
// Your config has a default of 10, the original README example was 50.
}
**Note:** The `chat_rank.js` file does not explicitly mention a prefix (e.g., `!message`) for sending global messages when proximity chat is enabled. If this feature is desired, it would need to be implemented or clarified.

<details>
<summary>👤 Player Name Customization</summary>

Allows administrators to set a custom display name for players using a command. This custom name is then used in chat messages (via the `$player` keyword) and in the "belowname" display.

**Command:** `-rank name`
This command opens a UI for:
- Selecting a player.
- Setting a new custom name for the selected player.
- Resetting a player's custom name back to their original Minecraft username.

The custom name is stored as a dynamic property on the player entity using the key `"ChatRank+"`.
</details>

<details>
<summary>🕒 Time Zone Configuration</summary>

Set the time zone to ensure that timestamps recorded in the chat logs (viewable with `-rank log`) are accurate for your server's primary audience or your administrative needs.

**Configuration (`scripts/config/config.js` > `time_zone`):**

time_zone: "UTC+2" // Example: Central European Summer Time (CEST).
// Format should be "UTC±H" or "UTC±HH:MM" (e.g., "UTC-5", "UTC+5:30", "UTC+0").

This setting adjusts the time recorded by the `ChatLogger` class.

# Maximum Customization
Chat Ranks+ offers extensive customization through its `config.js` file.
Locate this file typically at: `[Your Addon Behavior Pack Folder]/scripts/config.js`
(The exact path depends on your addon's folder structure; your `chat_rank.js` imports it as `../config.js`, meaning it's usually one directory level above the file performing the import, or in a `config` subfolder if the import path was `./config.js` from within the `scripts` directory).

Edit this file to tailor ranks, messages, timings, and all other features to your specific needs.





- 🖥️ Pc: 
```bash
%userprofile%\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang\
```
- 📱Android:
 ```bash
/Android/data/com.mojang.minecraftpe/files/games/com.mojang/

```

Remember that if the addon is inserted in the ‘behavior_packs’ folder, the changes made will not work when you enter the world or when you run the ‘/reload’ command to reload the scripts. To have real-time changes, the addon must be inserted in the ‘development_behavior_packs’ folder.
