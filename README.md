# ⚠️ Warning: Experimental Mode Required!
For Chat Ranks+ to function correctly, **you MUST enable "Beta APIs" (formerly JavaScript Creator Features)** in your world settings.

Remember that newer addon versions (e.g., v1.0.3+) support specific Minecraft versions (e.g., 1.20.80+). For older MCBE versions, download older addon versions (e.g., v1.0.0-v1.0.1), keeping in mind they may not include all the latest features.

# What Does Chat Ranks+ Offer? ✨
- **Multi-Rank System:** Assign multiple visible ranks in chat, fully customizable.
- **Score-Based Rank System:** Display a player's score (e.g., "level") directly in chat.
- **Auto-Mute System:** Automatically monitors and prevents message spam in chat.
- **Auto Ban-Words System:** Filters specific words and applies automatic mutes after warnings.
- **Broadcast System:** Sends automatic, periodic messages to all players.
- **Message Saving System (Log):** Review messages sent by players, with search and management options.
- **Below Name Display (Belowname):** Customize the text shown above players' heads (nametag), including ranks, health, last message, and more.
- **Proximity Chat:** Limits message visibility to players within a certain radius.

- **Time Zone Configuration:** Ensures accurate timestamps in logs.
- **Maximum Customization and Configuration:** Modify every aspect via the `config.js` file.

# Chat Ranks+ Commands ⌨️
The default command prefix is `-` (e.g., `-rank help`), but it can be changed in the `scripts/config.js` file. Players will only see commands accessible to their rank when they run `-rank help`.

- `-rank add`: Opens a menu to assign a rank to a player.
- `-rank remove`: Opens a menu to remove a rank from a player.
- `-rank list`: Shows the list of configured ranks and their descriptions.
- `-rank help`: Shows available commands for the player's rank.
- `-rank menu`: Opens a UI menu with all main addon options.
- `-rank log`: Opens the player message log, with search and management options.
- `-rank mute`: Opens a menu to mute or unmute players.
- `-rank info`: Shows addon information (version, creator).
- `-rank name`: Opens a menu to manage custom player names (visible in chat and belowname).

Use the item `da:chat_rank_menu` (if configured and available) to quickly open the `-rank menu`!

# Maximum Customization
Chat Ranks+ offers extensive customization through its `config.js` file.
Locate this file typically at: `[Your Addon Behavior Pack Folder]/scripts/config.js`
Edit this file to tailor ranks, messages, timings, and all other features to your specific needs.

- 🖥️ Pc: 
```bash
%userprofile%\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang\
```
- 📱Android:
 ```bash
/Android/data/com.mojang.minecraftpe/files/games/com.mojang/
```
- 📱Ios: 
 ```bash
/On My iPhone/Minecraft/games/com.mojang/
```

Remember that if the addon is inserted in the ‘behavior_packs’ folder, the changes made will not work when you enter the world or when you run the ‘/reload’ command to reload the scripts. To have real-time changes, the addon must be inserted in the ‘development_behavior_packs’ folder.
